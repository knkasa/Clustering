# Cluster analysis
k-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN methods will be tested.  
  For Hierarchical, there are four linkage.  
  For DBSCAN, need to determine eps(distance).  

Run as 
```
python cluster_analysis.py  <config file path>
```

The image below is the hierarchical graph using the famous Iris data.
